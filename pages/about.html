            <p>Richard George Adams (1920 &#45; 2016) was an English novelist and writer of the books Watership Down, Maia, Shardik and The Plague Dogs. In 1974, two years after Watership Down was published, Adams became a full-time author. On his way to Stratford-upon-Avon with his two daughters he began to create the story of  what would later be Watership Down.
            Once Rex Collings agreed to publish it in 1972, it sold over a million copies in record time. The novel&#39;s combination of anthropomorphic fiction with naturalism has turned it into a modern classic. In 1975 Adams was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.  He served as writer-in-residence at the University of Florida and at Hollins University in Virginia. In 2015 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Winchester. Adams served as president of the U.K.&#39;s Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for a short time in the &#39;80s.</p>
